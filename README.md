#  Enhancing Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning on Imbalanced Data

I contributed to the development of a machine learning-driven cancer prediction model aimed at leveraging data science techniques for health insights:

 Data Preparation and Feature Engineering: Handled data cleaning, NaN removal, and feature engineering to enhance model performance. Conducted feature scaling and transformation for improved data normalization and interpretation.

 Machine Learning Model Selection: Explored various machine learning algorithms, ultimately selecting Random Forest as the primary model for its ease of use and robust performance.

 Cross-Validation and Resampling: Implemented cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting. Utilized SMOTE-ENN resampling within the cross-validation process to address class imbalance effectively.

 Model Evaluation and Performance: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importances. Visualized feature correlations and importances to gain insights into predictive factors.

 Healthcare Insights and Impact: Through this project, we aimed to provide valuable insights into cancer prediction, enabling early detection and intervention. By leveraging machine learning techniques and data science methodologies, we strive to contribute to improved healthcare outcomes and patient well-being.

This project showcased my proficiency in Python programming, machine learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and collaborative problem-solving. It underscores my commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technologies for impactful applications in healthcare and beyond.
